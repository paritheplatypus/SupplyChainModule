# Cloud-Based Batch Scheduling Optimizer Using Simulated Annealing

## Chapter 1: Overview and Getting Started

### 1.1 Overview

In this module, we will explore how to solve a complex scheduling problem using Simulated Annealing (SA), a probabilistic optimization algorithm. The goal is to assign manufacturing jobs to machines in a way that minimizes the total cost â€” including production costs, lateness penalties, job rejection costs, and unused machine capacity costs.

This module uses a Python-based implementation and introduces Q-learning for adaptive operator selection. You'll learn how to prepare the environment, deploy on AWS EC2, and automate the entire workflow using GitHub Actions.

### 1.2 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:

- Understand the role of SA in cloud-based job scheduling
- Deploy and execute Python optimization code on AWS EC2
- Automate optimization tasks using GitHub Actions
- Analyze Excel-based optimization results

### 1.3 Prerequisites

- AWS Free Tier account
- Basic familiarity with Python, Git, and GitHub
- Optional: Knowledge of job-shop scheduling, cloud infrastructure, and optimization theory
