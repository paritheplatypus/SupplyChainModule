In this lab module, learners will explore how Apache Airflow can be used to automate and orchestrate optimization workflows on the cloud.
The hands-on lab demonstrates how to implement and manage optimization problems such as 3D printing job scheduling using Simulated Annealing, and how these workflows can be extended to business process optimization problems like the Newsvendor model.

Learners will gain practical experience designing Airflow DAGs, parameterizing optimization algorithms, visualizing results, and interpreting convergence behavior â€” all in a reproducible, cloud-native setup using AWS EC2.
